# 🧠 ResNet18 on CIFAR-10

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the  paper:  
**"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition."**  
I used a ResNet-18 architecture and trained it on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## 📝 Paper Summary

The ResNet architecture introduces **residual connections** to ease the training of very deep networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily.  
This implementation replicates the structure and training strategy of ResNet18 tailored for CIFAR-10.
